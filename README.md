#Weather-App
#By Shardul Shah

#Information:

A weather app formed from scratch using a pre-existing API.

I have not enabled nor coded error-checking or input-checking functionalities. That is, the program is very easily breakable.
I will do so ASAP. This is a ongoing project, not a project that has been postponed to the future like some of my other repos.

The open source weather API in use: https://openweathermap.org/api 
All data collected from https://openweathermap.org/api. Any inaccuracy of weather information should be reported to the developers of openweathermap, not me.

#Future Additions:
1. SQLite3/BerkleyDB implementation to store past, present, and future data. 
2. Weather-App in another form, as an application which returns weather data in an organized fashion, so any website can use it. (Probably using Flask)
3. Improvements to GUI; making a web-based GUI using HTML, CSS, and JS.
