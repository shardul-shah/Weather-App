# Weather-App
# By Shardul Shah
A weather app formed from scratch using a preexisting API
I have not enabled nor coded error-checking or input-checking functionalities. That is, the program is very easily breakable.
I will do so ASAP. This is a ongoing project, not a project that has been postponed to the future like some of my other repos.
The open source weather API in use: https://openweathermap.org/api 
All data collected from https://openweathermap.org/api. Any inaccuracy of weather information should be reported to the developers of openweathermap, not me.
